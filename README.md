## Note

- I fetched the courses from mongodb. (I have five entries in my db)
- For the student I have the api to fetch using id, since setting up auth is out of scope of this project, I hardcoded a studentId to local storage and fetch the student for that studentId (For example if you set studentId(key) equal to 2 (value) you'll get that student info). Default value will be 1.
